Minoxidil alone works well for many people — it can thicken existing hair and stimulate new growth. But it usually takes longer to see strong results, and not everyone responds dramatically.

Minoxidil + derma roller (microneedling) can greatly boost results. Studies have shown that combining the two increases absorption of Minoxidil and stimulates the scalp’s natural healing and growth factors, often leading to faster, thicker, and more noticeable growth compared to using Minoxidil alone.

Tip: If you go with derma rolling, use a 0.5 mm roller once a week. Don’t apply Minoxidil immediately after rolling — wait at least 12–24 hours to avoid irritation.
