What is Minoxidil?

Minoxidil is a topical medication primarily used to promote hair growth and slow balding. It was originally developed as an oral drug to treat high blood pressure, but researchers discovered that one of its side effects was hair regrowth. This led to the development of topical Minoxidil for treating hair loss.

Mechanism of Action

Minoxidil works by widening blood vessels and opening potassium channels in the scalp. This enhances blood flow to hair follicles, delivering more oxygen and nutrients, which may help revive shrinking hair follicles and prolong the growth phase of hair (anagen phase).

Uses

Minoxidil is FDA-approved for:
	•	Androgenetic alopecia (male and female pattern baldness)
	•	General thinning or receding hairlines (off-label use in some cases)
	•	Often used on the scalp, but some also apply it to beards (off-label)

Effectiveness

Minoxidil is most effective in people under 40 years old who have recently started losing hair. Results vary, but many users experience:
	•	Reduced hair loss
	•	Thicker existing hair
	•	Moderate to significant regrowth over 3–6 months

Side Effects

Common side effects:
	•	Scalp irritation or dryness
	•	Temporary shedding in early use
Rare side effects:
	•	Rapid heartbeat
	•	Dizziness
	•	Unwanted facial hair

Formulations

Minoxidil comes in two main forms:
	•	Liquid (usually 2% or 5%)
	•	Foam (easier to apply, often less irritating)

Important Notes
	•	Must be used consistently (usually twice a day)
	•	Stopping use typically results in loss of any regrown hair
	•	Should not be applied to broken or irritated skin
