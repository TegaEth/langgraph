      "Summary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enables generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) models to retrieve and incorporate new information. It modifies interactions with a large language model (LLM) so that the model responds to user queries with reference to a specified set of documents, using this information to supplement information from its pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information. Use cases include providing chatbot access to internal company data or generating responses based on authoritative sources.\n",
      "RAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources. According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations, which have led to real-world issues like chatbots inventing policies or lawyers citing nonexistent legal cases.\n",
      "By dynamically retrieving information, RAG enables AI to provide more accurate responses without frequent retraining. According to IBM, \"RAG also reduces the need for users to continuously train the model on new data and update its parameters as circumstances evolve. In this way, RAG can lower the computational and financial costs of running LLM-powered chatbots in an enterprise setting.\"\n",
      "Beyond efficiency gains, RAG also allows LLMs to include source references in their responses, enabling users to verify information by reviewing cited documents or original sources. This can provide greater transparency, as users can cross-check retrieved content to ensure accuracy and relevance.\n",
      "The term \"retrieval-augmented generation\" (RAG) was first introduced in 2020 by Douwe Kiela, Patrick Lewis, Ethan Perez, Aleksandra Piktus, Fabio Petroni, Vladimir Karpukhin, Naman Goyal, Heinrich Küttler, Mike Lewis, Wen-tau Yih, Tim Rocktäschel, and Sebastian Riedel in their research paper Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks, at Meta.\n",

Designed to standardize context exchange between AI assistants and software environments, MCP provides a model-agnostic interface for reading files, executing functions, and handling contextual prompts. It was officially announced and open-sourced by Anthropic in November 2024, with subsequent adoption by major AI providers including OpenAI and Google DeepMind.\n"

[...] The new strategy is the latest step in a years-long EU campaign to end energy ties with Russia after its all-out invasion in 2022. But it lands as the bloc strains to sustain that momentum, with high energy prices denting economic growth and some politicians and firms calling for a return to Russian imports. [...] “Today the European Union sends a very clear message to Russia — no more,” EU energy chief Dan Jørgensen said as he unveiled the plan. “No more will we allow our member states to be blackmailed, no more will we indirectly help fill up the war chest in the Kremlin.\"',\n",

Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.\n",
      "Comparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n",

      "Summary: Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year. Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.\n",
      "Comparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n",
      "The rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire's output around 1916, which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier. Since China's transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation, the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China's economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.\n",

      "Summary: This is a list of countries by nominal GDP per capita. GDP per capita is the total value of a country's finished goods and services (Gross domestic product) divided by its total population (per capita).\n",
      "Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's standard of living; however, this is inaccurate because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income. Measures of personal income include average wage, real income, median income, disposable income and GNI per capita.\n",
      "Comparisons of GDP per capita are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries, see List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita. PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n",

      "Summary: The economy of Nigeria is a middle-income, mixed economy and emerging market with expanding manufacturing, financial, service, communications, technology, and entertainment sectors. It is ranked as the 53rd-largest economy in the world in terms of nominal GDP, the sixth largest in Africa and the 27th-largest in terms of purchasing power parity.\n",
      "The country's re-emergent manufacturing sector became the largest on the continent in 2013, and it produces a large proportion of goods and services for the region of West Africa. Nigeria's debt-to-GDP ratio was 36.63% in 2021 according to the IMF.\n",
      "Although oil revenues contributed 2/3 of state revenues, oil only contributes about 9% to the GDP. Nigeria produces about 2.7% of the world's oil supply. Although the petroleum sector is important, as Nigeria's government revenues still heavily rely on this sector, it remains a small part of the country's overall economy. The largely subsistence agricultural sector has not kept up with the country's rapid population growth. Nigeria was once a large net exporter of food, but currently imports some of its food products. Mechanization has led to a resurgence in the manufacturing and exporting of food products, and there was consequently a move towards food sufficiency. In 2006, Nigeria came to an agreement with the Paris Club to buy back the bulk of its owed debts from them, in exchange for a cash payment of roughly US$12 billion.\n",
      "According to a report by Citigroup, published in February 2011, Nigeria had the highest average GDP growth in the world between 2010 and 2050. Nigeria is one of two countries from Africa among the 11 Global Growth Generators countries.\n",

Countries are sorted by GDP (PPP) forecast estimates from financial and statistical institutions that calculate using market or government official exchange rates. The data given on this page are based on the international dollar, a standardized unit used by economists. Certain regions that are not widely considered countries such as Hong Kong also show up in the list if they are distinct jurisdiction areas or economic entities.\n",
      "GDP comparisons using PPP are arguably more useful than those using nominal GDP when assessing the domestic market of a state because PPP takes into account the relative cost of local goods, services and inflation rates of the country, rather than using international market exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in per capita income. It is however limited when measuring financial flows between countries and when comparing the quality of same goods among countries. PPP is often used to gauge global poverty thresholds and is used by the United Nations in constructing the human development index. These surveys such as the International Comparison Program include both tradable and non-tradable goods in an attempt to estimate a representative basket of all goods.\n",

The data is in millions of international dollars and was calculated and published by the IMF in October 2023. The second table includes data, mostly for the year 2022, for 180 of the 193 current United Nations member states as well as Hong Kong and Macau (the two Chinese Special Administrative Regions).

The data for GDP at purchasing power parity has also been rebased using the new International Comparison Program price surveys and extrapolated to 2007. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited recognition (such as Kosovo, Palestine and Taiwan) are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources.
